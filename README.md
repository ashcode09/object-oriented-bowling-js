Object Oriented Practice

Maybe to create a bowling scorecard?

Objects could be:
- 'Player', 'Game'







General set up:

git clone this

npm install to install dependencies

grunt to build the css and js files

'node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server' to run server - it will say where it's available, just go to that and click on the index.html file to view
