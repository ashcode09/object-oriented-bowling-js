Object Oriented Practice
========================

Bowling Scoreboard
==================

Objects
-------

Objects could be:

- 'Game'
- 'Player'
- 'Scoreboard'


Thinking process
-----------------

Creating players:
- [x] Can I start a game?
- [x] Can I add a player to the game?
- [x] Can I add multiple players to the game?
- [x] Can I name each player in the game?
- [x] Can I list each player by name?

Recording scores on the scoreboard:
- [x] Can I create a scoreboard?
- [x] Can I create *x* amount of rows for *x* amount of players?
- [x] Can I list my players on of each row on the scoreboard?
- [x] Can I create an empty scoreboard with 10 columns?
- [ ] Can a player's roll be recorded on the scoreboard?
- [ ] Can I see a player's overall score?
- [ ] Can I alternate through each player and record their rolls?
- [ ] Can I see each player's overall score?

Implementing the rules:
